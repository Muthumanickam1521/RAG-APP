## Motivation
You have ever struggled to know your purchase splitups in your credit card bill statement? I got you covered. I had to create a separate excel sheet just to verify whether i was charged extra without my knowledge. I thought it would be great if i have a CA friend who could simplify tell about my bills. Unfortunately, I don't have a CA friend. How can i make my life easier without having to fight with excel sheets every month. Well, the answer is Agentic RAG system (ARAG).

In simple words, given a document which is in any format and question about the document, ARAG application can simply parse through the document, fetch related information from the document and explain to us in efficient way.

## Have question about your file?
A couple of pre-requisites is needed to use:
    * a document (.pdf, .txt, .csv, .excel, .docx)
    * a question

1) Hit link to the streamlit app.
2) Upload a file (wait for secs)
3) Through questions 

# Limitations
Every project might have some limitations and caveats. Similarly, my rag app has a few restrictions that are listed below (as far as observed)

1) Can only handle 1 file 
2) Does not handle other unstructured data
3) Can only generate text response
4) PDF parsing might not be accurate

## Future version
I will work on these limitations and develop a light yet robust RAG application

1) A dedicated team of agents will be orchestrated. They work together and accomplish task and goals.
2) Multiple document handling 
3) Efficient indexing and retrieval mechanism like semantic based one.
4)
